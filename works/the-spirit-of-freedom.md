  <p>The Spirit of Freedom.</p>
  <p>
It's an occasion to remind ourselves and resolve to be responsible citizens for we have the right to demand but duties to fulfil before that. It's not about asking what is there in freedom for me. Rather, it's about asking ourselves what we can do for our society and country. Free to lead.</p>
